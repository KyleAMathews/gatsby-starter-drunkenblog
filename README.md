# gatsby-starter-drunkenblog
Gatsby starter for creating a blog

I wrote a [blog post](http://blog.jetboystudio.com/articles/gatsby) about it.

Install this starter (assuming Gatsby is installed) by running from your CLI:
`gatsby new gatsby-blog https://github.com/konsumer/gatsby-starter-drunkenblog`

## Running in development
`gatsby develop`

## deploying to gh-pages

If you have a custom domain, put it in `pages/CHANME`. You can deploy to Google Pages with `npm run deploy`.


## configuration

Go edit `config.toml`. Change it to all of your stuff. change `components/profile-pic.png` to your own picture.

### disabling google analytics

Just delete `gatsby-browser.js`.
